# cpsd
cpsd is a database to develop church planting strategy. 
It is originally created for mission organizations around the world to plant churches in Japan - the couontry with world's [second largest](https://joshuaproject.net/unreached/1?s=Population&o=desc) unreached people group.

## Background
I converted from atheist physics fanboy to evangelical Christian when I was a student of [ICU](https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/) (International Christian University). 
Changed my major from physics to computer sciencce as I felt CS is pragmatically more usuful for world evangelism. 
At that time I also started an internship at [Christian Today Japan](https://www.christiantoday.co.jp/english.htm) as Full Stack Developer and reporter. 
I moved from Japan to US to earn Master of Arts in Information Technology from [OIT](https://oit.olivetuniversity.edu/) (Olivet Institute of Technology) while majoring Missiology and Software Engineering together. 
Primary interest was to leverage tech for world mission strategy all the way from micro strategy like locating church absent cities to macro strategy like global interindustrial logistics.
After serving as a minister of [G&IT](https://gnit.org/) (Gospel & Information Techcnology) in United States, I moved back to Japan to work as editor in chief of Christian Today Japan.
Intersection of Christianity, Journalism and Information Technology has been my field. I was always interested in the advancement of [Data Journalism](https://datajournalism.com/).
Now that I spent 1 year in the world of online Christian Journalim and [FaithTech](https://faithtech.com/), came to know almost nobody practice Data Journalism in our field. 
That was the moment I felt God called me to be the first one to do [that](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nehemiaharchives/cpsd/master/Christian_Data_Journalism.svg). First topic I chose was meant for something useful for World Mission Strategy.

## Current Project
Now at the starting point, cpsd is limited to for the usage in mission strategy in Japan in English. 
First dataset is location of churches and train stations with passenger count and distance.

## Future
Hoping to apply for other countries, accomodate other type of data and languages.

## Code of Conduct
Matthew 28:19-20 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. " - Jesus Christ
